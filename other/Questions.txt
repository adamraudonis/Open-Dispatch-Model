Interesting Questions we want to answerEVDay, vs Night charging? Impact on gridDumb vs Smart charging? Does it make a difference?With smart, is there the potential to curtail wind.Something with low growth vs high? I think maybe just pick oneWhile just picking one is easy, applying that range uncertainty to all other results seems trickyRandom: Result difference between inperpolating and not?BatteriesAt what $/kW or $/kWh are batteries cost effective to compete with a SCCT, CCCT?What are the different benefits, costs of 1-2,4,8,12 ratios of kW-kWh?What sizes should be used 500,1000,2000,3000,4000MW?Should we have the batteries added to the grid increase every year?WindAt what point will wind create significant curtailment requirements as measured in MW, MWhAt what point will wind create significant ramps? Look at baseline max hourly diff and wind scenario max diffProbably don't have time, but look at transmission costs plus benefit of importing better windWhat is the most cost effective optimization between increasing wind and batteries?What's the marginal benefit of adding more wind plus batteries? Does it make economic sense with CCCT?At what price does natural gas have to rise to for this to work?CoalCan PGE survive without the coal plans?What will be the rate payer impacts?CarbonWhat are the carbon reductions of all the plans?If carbon is priced, how does that change things?EconomicsWhat are the annual operating costs for each scenario?What will the rates be for each scenario?OtherWe haven't given any consideration to efficiency. What to do about that?ResultsShould we just say what options we want and then simulate all possible scenarios?What should our methodology be for picking out scenarios?
