This is going to be a very complicated project. We need to have practice consistent and good coding style conventions if our project is to be more useful than the excel doc.

If you come up with something you think should be universal, please let the group know and document it below.

Here are just a couple I thought up. If you have any issues with them, I’d be more than happy to change it as long as we’re consistent across the code base.

1. Declare the names of all input files under constants. Please document the human readable name, a quick description of the contents/purpose of the file, and finally a list of the headers in the file or other formatting info.

2. Please comment global variables.

3. Let’s use _ instead of camelCase. For Ex: load_forcasts instead of loadForcasts
