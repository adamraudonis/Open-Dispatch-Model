You must make sure you are ‘CDed’ into your Open-Dispatch-Model

Do this by typing cd (space) then dragging in the Open-Dispatch Model folder.

IF YOU WANT TO GET THINGS
git pull

IF YOU WANT TO PUSH THING
git status (you can get an idea for what are your changes)
git add -A . 
git commit -m “ENTER A MESSAGE HERE THAT IS MEANINGFUL! No, ‘made changes’ bs”

(At this point all changes are still on your computer)

git status  (should say “nothing to commit, working directory clean”)
If it doesn’t say that exactly try git add -A . and committing again.

git push (This will update the server so we can all see it.

Just a tip: Press Apple-K to clear the terminal of text. Control-C, stops code.
